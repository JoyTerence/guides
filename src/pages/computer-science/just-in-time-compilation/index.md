## Just in Time Compilation

Just in Time compilation is a type of dynamic compilation where the compilation is done during run time instead of compiling entire code beforehand and invoking this entire compiled code when run.

The main advantage of this approach is that Just in Time(JIT) compiler has additional dynamic information about code structure, that a traditional static compiler doesn't, and hence can make better optimizations. 

Thus, it increases the performance of execution and also is suggested to perform better when there are repeated sections in program.
